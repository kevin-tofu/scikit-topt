Project
============


**Purpose of this Project**
 Scikit-Topt is a lightweight and flexible Python library for topology optimization — 
a computational approach for determining the optimal shape and material layout of structures and components.

Using the finite element method (FEM), topology optimization automatically generates efficient and 
high-performance designs by redistributing material to achieve a given objective, such as minimizing compliance 
under a volume constraint.

The library aims to make topology optimization accessible, transparent, and practical for both academic research 
and real-world engineering. It provides modular tools for assembling finite element models, defining optimization 
problems, and visualizing results, enabling users to experiment with algorithms, benchmark methods, and integrate 
topology optimization into their existing simulation workflows.
